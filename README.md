This readme is super WIP. Just writing some notes about dependencies and stuff
Notes:
    If running on linux do "source .venv/bin/activate" and then install necessary dependencies.
    Current .venv dependencies: natsort, torch (PyTorch), tphate
    Most of the other dependencies are just installed globally nothing crazy, numpy and stuff
