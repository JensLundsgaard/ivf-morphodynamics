This readme is super WIP. Just writing some notes about dependencies and stuff
Notes:
    * If running on linux do "source .venv/bin/activate" and then install necessary dependencies. 
    * If running on mac/windows just install all the necessary dependencies with pip install
    * If you clone to linux you'll need to create a .venv environment, run "source .venv/bin/activate", and install the dependencies there
    * Current .venv dependencies: natsort, torch (PyTorch), tphate
    * Most of the other dependencies are just installed globally nothing crazy, numpy and stuff
